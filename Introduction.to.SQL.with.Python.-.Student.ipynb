    "#### DISCLAIMER:\n",
    "______________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "There are many ways to browse through a SQL database, throughout this workshop we are going to be focusing on learning about SQL queries using a combination of Python, SQLite, and pandas. Please note that this is a pretty specific way of operating with a SQL Database, and may or may not fit other general needs. The primary goal of this section is to teach you how to use SQL queries to grab information and set it as a pandas DataFrame. We will not be going over more general topics of relational databases, MySQL, or using a SQL console directly.\n",

    "#### Step 1: Download SQL Alchemy\n",
    "To start this appendix, download SQLAlchemy. You can do this by either downloading it\n",
    "by typing conda install sqlalchemy if you are using the Anaconda installation of Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 2: Download SQLite Broswer\n",
    "Next up we will download a sql browser. We will be using SQLite Browser because it is lightweight and free to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Download SQLite Browser here: http://sqlitebrowser.org/\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 3: Download the sakila Database\n",
    "You can download the fully constructed database here\n",

    "\n",
    "Make sure to save it in the same directory as your iPython notebooks, or remember the file path for later so we can tell pandas exactly where to look for it.\n",

    "#### All done! Now let's look at the database before diving into how to work with it in Python.\n",

The module is SQLite3, let's go ahead and import it (and pandas as well)."
